I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Trinity College Dublin. My research is at the intersection of applied microeconomics and development economics. 

Much of my research uses GIS data and self-collected data to investigate the impacts of internal displacement on the population displaced and their host communities. For instance, my work tackles questions such as Do forced displaced population flows have long-term social participation effects on their host communities? or How does forced displacement affect the timing of marriage, particularly, early marriage? and If traditional marriage payment norms influence such a relationship? 

During my Phd I have worked as a consultant for the UNDP. Previously, I worked for the United Nations and the OECD.
