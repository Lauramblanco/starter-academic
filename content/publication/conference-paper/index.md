abstract: By 2018, 70.8 million people worldwide had been forced to flee from their home (UNHCR, 2019). This paper explores how variation in exposure to internally displaced population that happened in the past affects social participation in host municipalities during the last 40 years. To measure forced displacement, I exploit the construction of reservoirs during the Spanish dictatorship (1936-1975). Infrastructures that forced thousands of people to displacement. I rely on a newly collected historical dataset on forced displacement and social participation to then implement an instrumental variable approach. I find that exposure to internally displaced population inflows has a long-term and sizable benefit on social participation. Interestingly, the effects occurred right after the arrival of displaced population and persisted over 50 years. I propose two mechanisms for these results, social ties moving together with the population displaced and an upward shift in trust. Results are robust to potential cofounding effects of violence during the dictatorship. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
